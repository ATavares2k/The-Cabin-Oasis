// This project is connected to Supabase and, at this stage, requires a key to connect to the database. For obvious reasons, I will not provide the key!  
// Still, you can review the project code without the key,and still clone! but some things won't render.
// Feel free to do so :)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.
